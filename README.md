# BPI Challenge 2020

The purpose of this repository is to maintain code and text produced to analyze this year's BPI Challenge: https://icpmconference.org/2020/bpi-challenge/

## Repository Contents
 * Cleaned versions of the event logs (see the [data folder](data/cleaned_logs))
 * A [class diagram](data-model/Classdiagram.png) showing attributes and relations of the logs
 * [Jupyter Notebooks](notebook) we used for analyzing the logs. [Below](#notebooks) you will find a brief overview of the included notebooks and their purposes.


### Notebooks üìì
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è *Please note that you need to have [PM4Py](https://pm4py.fit.fraunhofer.de/install) installed in order to be able to execute the notebooks by yourself. However, the notebooks contained in this repository already include the respective results, just click on any notebook name in the table below.*
